# TAKEONE3D
This project was to convert MakerBot Replicator 2 which had failed with me several times and had lots of issues when trying to print because it didnt have a heated bed at the beginning so i bought a heated bed but the board dosent support it. so i decided swap the board and convert it to marlin firmware 2.0 with auto leveling and heated bed, here you will find every thing, from wiring and steps i took and the boards i used.

## The Board I Used ?
I had another 3d printer which is Anet A8, it was givent to me by a friend because he didnt know how to operate it since it was a DIY, but never had time for it, so i dismantled the board and thought why not change the firmware to operate my old MakerBot Replicator 2 -> i renamed the 3D Printer To TAKEONE3D Printer.

The Board Brand Was BIQU Bigtreetech KFB 2.
